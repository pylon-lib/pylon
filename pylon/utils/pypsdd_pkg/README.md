# The PyPSDD Package (BETA)
## version 0.1, July 4, 2018

The PyPSDD Package is a python module for learning and reasoning with
Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs).

(This is a **beta** release: there are probably bugs.)

The PyPSDD Package can read in SDDs constructed by the SDD package:

  http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/sdd

which is an open-source system (in the C language) for constructing
and manipulating SDDs.  Various wrappers are also available:

* PySDD (Python): https://github.com/wannesm/PySDD
* JSDD (Java): https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/JSDD

We suggest using the PyPy interpreter (https://pypy.org/) with the
PyPSDD Package.
